## Something more specific
He didnt know it at the time but his last meal with his Grandfather would have a connection to thier entire Relationship. Nicks love of sea food started with sharing smoked fish with his grandpa at the age of four the same snack he would share with him the last time he saw him alive.

## Analysis: Smoke, Memory, and Belonging

listing back to my food story what becomes very clear is how much food can transend things like taste. The fish was less about how much i enjoyed it and more about a feeling of bonding and belonging with my Grandfather. This highlights an idea we talked about in class were food can have a deeper meaning and the sharing of food pathways can lead to a greater understanding of diffrent people. 
It also shows that food can be about memory. Smoked fish and seafood in general will always be tied to memories of my grandpa.
